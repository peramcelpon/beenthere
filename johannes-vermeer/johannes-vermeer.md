# Works by Johannes Vermeer

### Rijksmuseum - 2018 Nov 11
- **Woman reading a letter**, 1663
    - tranquility, overtone if blue
    - shadows on the wall in shades of blue
    - pale gray color for the womanâ€™s skin
    - simplicity in composition 
    - blurred background
    - light dances in the night jacket
- **The love letter**, 1667-1670
    - a common subject, through a door
    - broom and household items in the forgriund
    - intriguing vantage point
    - seascape and ship in the background - which is often an analogy for life in 17th century 
- **The Little Street**
